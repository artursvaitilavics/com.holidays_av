1. Security Logins for admints, who add companies
2. Security login for managers, who when log in, can add
    employees to currently logged in company
3. Security - for users, once logged in, they can make holiday requests

BIG TODOS:
1. Adjust existing holiday, if startDate or endDate changes. 




Security, how should it work:

open page, we see only register company. once you register company, you are in this company's webpage, and adding
new employee would automaticly set it's company the current open.
