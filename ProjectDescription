holidays_av

This project will be a platform that can be used by different
companies to track their employees holidays.
For Back End I am using Java Spring and MySql DB.
For the development stage I use H2 in memory database.Front End React JS.

At this point Back End is at its early stage and the front end has just started.
From this point onwards Back-End and Front-End will progress in tandem.
